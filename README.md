- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @emmacari

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in maths an chess, those are my passions,
I'm learning more about programming because it's fun

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to programm, I think I can do good things.
Those things are more related to my preparation as a mathematician +han
any other thing. I'm learing to programm and I feel confident about
my habilities to learn.

<!---If you can talk to me in English I'll play chess with you.
I'm pretty good :)
